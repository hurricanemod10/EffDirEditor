# EffDirEditor

This project converts old MATLAB scripts (`WriteEffDir.m`, `IsolateEff.m`, etc.) for working with SimCity 4 EffDir files into Python.

- Isolate specific effects by name or index
- Cross-platform (Python), with Windows `.exe` build via GitHub Actions

## Usage
Once built, you can run:
